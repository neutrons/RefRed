Developer Documentation
=======================

These pages contain the developer documentation. They are aimed at those who are modifying the
source code of the project.

Quick tasks, such as building the documentation can be carried out with `pixi` tasks at the top of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   ‚ùØ pixi task list                                                                                                                                                                                                                (RefRed)
